# City List Definition:
<p>A list of cities (<strong>marrakech</strong>, <strong>casablanca</strong>, <strong>agadir</strong>, and <strong>fes</strong>) is initialized, indicating that the script is designed to scrape booking-related information for these specific locations.</p>

# Base URL Setup:
<p>After defining the target cities, the next step is likely the configuration of the base URL that will serve as the foundation for the web scraping operations, making it adaptable for the cities listed.</p>
